# Boston-Crime-Analysis

Overview

This repository contains both R and Shinydashboard codes. The R code provides visualizations that gives an insight into incident hotspots, proportion of shooting incidents, time of the day with the most incidents reported etc. The shinny dashboard can serve as a tool for the police department to have a 360 degrees view of the incidents, better that a static database. It provides an interface to search and find incident details based on different filters like month, day, incident name etc. 

This project was written and executed in R Studio

Dataset was obtained from Kaggle, with records begining in June 14, 2015 and continued to September 3, 2018.
